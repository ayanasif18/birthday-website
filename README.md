# Memories Premium — Purple Edition

This is an upgraded Memories/Happy Birthday website template with:
- Floating hearts animation
- Typewriter heading
- Gallery with hover, lightbox, next/prev, keyboard & swipe support
- Background music (replace `assets/music.mp3` with your MP3)
- Love notes (glassmorphism cards)
- Scroll reveal animations
- Responsive design and footer glow

## How to personalize
1. Replace images in `assets/` with your own photos (keep file names or update `index.html`).
2. Put an MP3 file named `music.mp3` into `assets/` to enable background music.
3. Edit the name in `<span id="her-name">[Her Name]</span>` inside `index.html`.
4. Open `index.html` locally or host on GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel.

Enjoy — if you want, send the photos and the MP3 and I'll rebuild the ZIP with them included.
